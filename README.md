## Anomaly Detection System

### Modular Architecture (ML-Ready)

The system uses a **pluggable detection engine** that can be easily swapped:

```c
// Current: Threshold-based detection
typedef struct {
    float vibration_threshold;  // 5.0 mm/s danger level
    float temp_threshold;       // 70°C warning level
    uint32_t rpm_min, rpm_max;  // 18-22 RPM normal range
} ThresholdDetector_t;

// Future: Can be replaced with ML model
typedef struct {
    float (*inference)(SensorData_t*);  // ML inference function
    void* model_weights;                // Trained model data
} MLDetector_t;
```

### Current Implementation: Smart Thresholds
- Moving average baseline tracking
- Standard deviation for dynamic thresholds
- Trend analysis (increasing vibration over time)
- Multi-sensor correlation

### Detection Examples
```
Normal:     Vibration=2.5mm/s, Temp=45°C → Health: 95% ✅
Warning:    Vibration=4.8mm/s, Temp=52°C → Health: 72% ⚠️
Critical:   Vibration=8.2mm/s, Temp=68°C → Health: 31% 🔴
```
