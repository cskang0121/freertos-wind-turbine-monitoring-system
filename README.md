## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Mac/Linux development tools
brew install cmake ninja

# Python environment (for monitoring and future ML)
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Platform Clarification

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT - SIMULATION ONLY**: 
- This project runs ONLY in POSIX simulation on Mac/Linux
- Uses generic FreeRTOS v10.4.3 with POSIX port
- All sensors and peripherals are simulated
- No actual hardware support implemented
- Educational demonstration of FreeRTOS concepts

**Potential Future Extensions** (not implemented):
- Hardware ports would require significant code changes
- Platform-specific drivers would need to be written
- Hardware abstraction layer would need to be implemented

### Building and Running

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd wind-turbine-predictor

# Clone FreeRTOS kernel (required)
git clone --branch V10.4.3 https://github.com/FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS-Kernel.git external/FreeRTOS-Kernel

# Build for simulation (Mac/Linux)
./scripts/build.sh simulation

# Run the integrated Wind Turbine Monitor (Capability 1 Complete)

## Anomaly Detection System

### Current Implementation: Threshold-Based Detection

The system implements simple threshold-based anomaly detection:

```c
// Threshold-based detection (implemented)
typedef struct {
    float vibration_threshold;  // 5.0 mm/s danger level
    float temp_threshold;       // 70¬∞C warning level
    uint32_t rpm_min, rpm_max;  // 18-22 RPM normal range
} ThresholdDetector_t;
```

**Note**: Machine learning capabilities are not implemented. This is a demonstration of basic threshold detection only.

### Detection Features
- Moving average baseline tracking
- Standard deviation for dynamic thresholds
- Trend analysis (increasing vibration over time)
- Multi-sensor correlation

### Detection Examples
```
Normal:     Vibration=2.5mm/s, Temp=45¬∞C ‚Üí Health: 95% ‚úÖ
Warning:    Vibration=4.8mm/s, Temp=52¬∞C ‚Üí Health: 72% ‚ö†Ô∏è
Critical:   Vibration=8.2mm/s, Temp=68¬∞C ‚Üí Health: 31% üî¥
```
